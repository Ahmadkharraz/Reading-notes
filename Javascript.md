- React to events.

<br>

#### What is a **script** ?
- A **script** is a series of instructions that a computer can follow step by step to achieve a goal. Script is just like recipes and manuals.

<br>


#### How to write a **script** ?
<p>You need to define your goal and list the tasks needed to be completed in order to achieve that goal.</p>

- Start with the big picture of what you want to achive and breake that down into smaller steps.
- Define the goal then design the script ( split it into smaller tasks ), then code each step.
- Start by drawing a flowchart.


### **Expressions**
<p>An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking there are two types of expressions: </p>
1. EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A VALUE TO A VARIABLE, like : var myName = 'Ahmad'; 

2. EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR MORE VALUES TO RETURN A SINGLE VALUE, like : var average = 90 / 4; 

### Operators 
Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow  rogrammers to create a single value from one or more values.

1. ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS  =

2. ARITHMETIC OPERATORS ; +, -, *, / ...

3. STRING OPERATORS , + , it calls concatenating.

4. COMPARISON OPERATORS ; < >

5. LOGICAL OPERATORS ; && , || 


## **Function**

#### What is a Function?
- Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements). 

<br>

**Declaring a function**

What is function declaration?

* To create a function, you give it a name and then write the statements needed to achieve its task inside the brackets

Example : function myName(){ document.write('Ahmad')}

Steps to declare a function:

1. You can declare a function by using function keyword.

2. Then give the function a name (identifier) followed by parentheses.

3. The statement that perform the task sit in a code block inside the brackets.

**Calling a function**

When a function is declared you can call it; executing all of the statements between its curly brackets with just one line of code.
Example: myName()
