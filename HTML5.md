# HTML5 Layout

- For a long time, web page authors used div elements to  roup
together related elements on the page (such as the elements that form a header, an article, footer or sidebar). Authors used class or id attributes to indicate the role of the div element in the structure of the page.
- HTML5 introduces a new set of elements that allow you to divide up the
parts of a page. The names of these elements indicate the kind of content
you will find in them. They are still subject to change, but that has not
stopped many web page authors using them already.
- New tags just like Header, Footer, Navigation, Article, Aside, section and heading group.
- Older browsers that do not
know the new HTML5 elements
will automatically treat them as
inline elements. Therefore, to
help older browsers, you should
include the line of CSS on the
left which states which new
elements should be rendered as
block-level elements

> Summary
- The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of
different parts of a web page and help to describe
its structure.
- The new elements provide clearer code (compared
with using multiple <div> elements).
- Older browsers that do not understand HTML5
elements need to be told which elements are
block-level elements.
- To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8
(and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed,
which is available free from Google.
