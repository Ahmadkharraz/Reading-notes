**Growth mindset** believes that one’s essential abilities can be developed through perseverance and effort; intelligence and talent are simply good starting points.

You can find the difference between a fixed mindset and a growth one depending on the following factors:
1. Challaneges; Whenever you got a challenge you have to continue in the solution and not to quit.
2. Obstacles; Whenever you got an obstacle in work or life you have to stand up and do the task .
3. Effort; You have to make a conscious effort to stop and think about the growth mindset, and do the hard work till you accomplish what you want.
4. Criticism; Best questions to ask myself are two questions: What was the best part of the day?
What went wrong, and how can I make sure it doesn’t happen again?
And don't judge your work based on your mood.
5. Success of others; Some open and frank conversations with my fellow Atlassians during peer reviews, one-on-ones, and even in casual hallway interactions helped me in this shift of mindset. Because that’s another amazing thing about the way our company works: we have access to literally everyone in the company.
