        <h1>Growth mindset</h1>
        <p>Definition; believes that one’s essential abilities can be developed through perseverance and effort; intelligence and talent are simply good starting points.</p>
        <h4>You can find the difference between a fixed mindset and a growth one depending on the following factors:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Challaneges; Whenever you got a challenge you have to continue in the solution and not to quit.</li>
            <li>Obstacles; Whenever you got an obstacle in work or life you have to stand up and do the task .</li>
            <li>Effort; You have to make a conscious effort to stop and think about the growth mindset, and do the hard work till you accomplish what you want.</li>
            <li>Criticism; Best questions to ask myself are two questions: What was the best part of the day? What went wrong, and how can I make sure it doesn’t happen again? And don't judge your work based on your mood.</li>
            <li>Success of others; Some open and frank conversations with my fellow Atlassians during peer reviews, one-on-ones, and even in casual hallway interactions helped me in this shift of mindset. Because that’s another amazing thing about the way our company works: we have access to literally everyone in the company.</li>
