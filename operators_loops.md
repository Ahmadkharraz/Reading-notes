# Operators and Loops

## Operators

<p> There are two types of operators :</p>

1. Comparison operators ; always return true or false

- == Is equal to ; it compares 2 values without the dataype.
- === Strict equal to ; it compares 2 values with respect to the dataype.
- != Is not equal to ; it compares 2 values to see if there are not the same without respect to the datatype.
- !== Strict not equal to; it compares 2 values with respect to the datatype if they are not the same.
- (>) Greater than ; checks if the number on the left side is greater than the number on the right side.
- (>=) Greater than or equal ; checks if the number on the left side is greater or equal than the number on the right side.
- (<) Less than ; checks if the number on the left side is less than the number on the right side.
- (<=) Less than or equal ; checks if the number on the left side is less or equal than the number on the right side.

2. Logical operators; to compare the results of more than one comparison ooperator.
- && And 

| 1st comparison      | 2nd comparison | result     |
| :---        |    :----:   |          ---: |
| true      | true       | true   |
| true   | false        | false      |
| false   | true        | false      |
| false   | false        | false      |

- || Or

| 1st comparison      | 2nd comparison | result     |
| :---        |    :----:   |          ---: |
| true      | true       | true   |
| true   | false        | true      |
| false   | true        | true      |
| false   | false        | false      |

- ! Not

!true resturs false
!false returns true

## Loops
- Loops check a condition ; if it is true a code block will run.
- for (initliazation;condition;update){block of code}
- while (condition){block of code to execute}
